# EDUVERA — Product Functionality Specification

**Document:** 03_PRODUCT_FUNCTIONALITY.md  
**Scope:** Web + Android + iOS school operating system  
**Basis:** Functional concepts present in the uploaded EDUVERA JSX prototype, expanded into a production product specification.

---

## 1. Product definition

EDUVERA is a unified operating platform for an education provider, in any country.

Target institutions:

- schools — primary, secondary, K-12,
- playschools — nursery, preschool, early years, daycare,
- coaching and tutoring centres — test preparation, skills and vocational training,
- colleges and higher education institutions.

It connects:

- institution leadership,
- administration,
- admissions,
- accounts and finance,
- teachers, tutors and faculty,
- guardians,
- learners,

through one authoritative institution data model.

These institution types share the same domain model and differ by capability profile, vocabulary and fee shape rather than by codebase. What a user sees is resolved from the tenant's institution type, jurisdiction, currency, calendar and locale.

The platform should replace fragmented workflows spread across:

- spreadsheets,
- paper registers,
- payment portals,
- WhatsApp groups,
- isolated school ERP screens,
- email,
- separate learning portals.

The key differentiator is not simply “all modules in one app.”

The product should provide:

> **A permission-aware operating system where each user sees the school through their responsibility, with AI able to reason across the records they are already allowed to access.**

---

### Family

#### Parent/guardian

Needs:

- all linked children,
- attendance,
- fees,
- leave,
- timetable,
- assignments,
- results,
- messages,
- notices,
- AI explanation.

#### Adult learner

College and coaching learners are frequently adults and are the data subject for their own records.

- attendance,
- assignments,
- submissions,
- results,
- messages,
- notices,
- AI study assistance.

---

### SaaS operator

#### Eduvera super administrator

## 4. Authentication and onboarding

### 4.1 School staff

Possible flow:

1. School creates staff account or syncs directory.
2. Staff receives invite.
3. Verify email/phone.
4. Set authentication method.
5. MFA if required.
6. Select school/campus if user belongs to multiple.
7. Backend resolves roles/scopes.
8. App builds navigation.

---

### 4.2 Parent

Flow:

1. School creates or invites guardian.
2. Parent verifies phone/email.
3. System links guardian to student records.
4. Parent confirms linked children.
5. Consent/notices shown where required.
6. Parent lands on family home.

A parent must never gain access to a child only because names/phone numbers happen to match.

---

### 4.3 Student

Flow depends on school policy:

- school-issued account,
- student ID + activation,
- managed SSO,
- guardian-assisted activation for younger students.

Student permissions remain self-scoped.

---

## 5. Capability and role administration

Administrators can create roles such as:

- Principal
- Admissions
- Accounts
- Teacher
- Class Teacher
- Academic Coordinator
- Timetable Coordinator
- Counselor
- Transport Manager

Permissions are granular.

Example:

```text
fees.read
fees.invoice.create
fees.concession.request
fees.concession.approve
fees.refund
fees.export
```

Scope can be:

- entire school,
- one campus,
- grades,
- sections,
- assigned classes,
- linked children,
- self.

---

## 6. Home / dashboard

### Staff

Widgets are permission-aware.

Possible widgets:

- students on roll
- attendance today
- fee collection
- open applications
- upcoming events
- missing attendance registers
- overdue invoices
- timetable conflicts
- unread priority conversations
- approvals
- scheduled reports

The prototype’s “Needs attention” concept should become central.

---

### Parent

Home combines family status.

Child-scoped cards:

- attendance
- timetable
- assignments
- academic results

Family/action cards:

- fees
- messages
- notices
- upcoming events

---

### Student

- next class
- rest of today
- due soon
- attendance
- current academic average
- results
- announcements
- study assistant

---

## 7. Admissions

The prototype includes a pipeline with stages such as:

- New
- Contacted
- Assessment
- Offer
- Enrolled

Production should make stages configurable.

### 7.1 Enquiry

---

### 7.7 Enrollment conversion

When admitted:

1. validate mandatory documents,
2. create Student,
3. create guardian links,
4. create enrollment,
5. allocate student ID,
6. assign grade/section,
7. apply fee plan,
8. optionally assign transport,
9. create portal accounts,
10. send onboarding communication.

This should be transactional/idempotent.

---

## 8. Student Information System

Student profile:

### Identity

- name
- date of birth
- photo
- gender where required
- contact details where appropriate

### Academic placement

- academic year

- incidents/interventions if school uses them

Sensitive modules should have separate permissions.

---

## 9. Fees and billing

The uploaded prototype already emphasizes transparent fee structure, invoice breakdown, overdue status, payment history and reminders.

Production functionality:

### 9.1 Fee plans

Every fee plan is denominated in an explicit currency and carries a tax treatment per component. Neither is ever implied by the deployment.

By:

- enrolment period — academic year, semester, term or batch
- class group — grade, year group, batch, programme or course
- campus
- stream or specialization
- learner category

Components, by institution type:

```text
school / playschool   admission, tuition, technology/lab, activity,
                      examination, transport, meals, uniform, optional services
coaching centre       course or batch fee, material fee, mock test series,
                      registration, instalment surcharge
college               tuition, per-credit charges, laboratory, library,
                      hostel/accommodation, examination, convocation
```

Frequency:

- one-time
- annual
- semester or term
- monthly
- per-credit or per-course
- custom schedule

Each component carries:

- currency,
- tax treatment (exempt, zero-rated, reduced, standard) resolved from the tenant tax profile,
- whether the displayed price is tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive,
- refundability, which differs by component and by jurisdiction.

Tuition is exempt or zero-rated for tax in many jurisdictions while transport, meals, uniforms and commercial short courses are not. Tax treatment must therefore be set per component, never per invoice.

---

### 9.2 Student fee assignment

Supports:

- base fee plan
- concessions
- scholarships
- sibling discount
- transport
- optional services
- manual adjustment with approval

Every change should retain history.

---

### 9.3 Invoice

Fields:

- invoice number, allocated from a tenant invoice series at issue
- document type — invoice, credit note, proforma
- learner
- bill-to party — guardian, sponsor, employer or the adult learner
- issuer identity — legal entity, address, tax registration number
- issue date
- supply/service date, where the jurisdiction requires it
- due date
- currency
- line items, each with quantity, unit price, tax treatment, tax rate and tax amount
- discount/concession
- tax summary by rate
- total, tax total and grand total
- rounding applied
- amount paid
- balance
- status
- locale used for rendering

Statuses:

- Draft — editable, no allocated number
- Issued — immutable and numbered
- Partly paid
- Paid
- Due
- Overdue
- Cancelled — retained with its number, never deleted
- Credited / Partly credited

### 9.3.1 Issued invoices are immutable

An issued invoice is never edited, re-priced or deleted. Corrections are made by issuing a linked credit note, and where necessary a replacement invoice.

This is a legal requirement in most jurisdictions and the only basis on which reconciliation, tax reporting and audit can be trusted.

Staff-facing wording must make this explicit: the action is "issue a credit note", not "edit invoice".

### 9.3.2 Numbering

Invoice numbers come from a configured series per tenant, and where required per campus, jurisdiction or document type. Several jurisdictions require the sequence to be gapless. Numbers are allocated at issue, never at draft creation, and are never reused after cancellation.

Credit notes use their own series.

### 9.3.3 Presentation

The invoice document is rendered in the recipient's language and locale, with the tenant's legal entity details, tax registration and any statutory wording required by the jurisdiction. Currency is always displayed with an explicit currency indicator — an unlabelled amount is ambiguous to an international audience.

Where a jurisdiction mandates electronic invoicing or fiscal clearance, issue additionally submits the document through that channel and records the authority reference against the invoice.

---

### 9.4 Payer experience

The payer may be a guardian, a sponsor, an employer or the adult learner.

The payer sees:

- exact payable amount, with an explicit currency
- breakdown, including tax where applicable
- due date in their own timezone
- any payment fee, where surcharging is lawful in that market
- the payment methods available in their country
- instalment option if allowed

Flow:

1. select invoice,
2. inspect amount,
3. choose a payment method available for the tenant's country and the payer's,
4. initiate payment,
5. complete authentication where required — 3-D Secure, bank redirect, or mandate confirmation,
6. webhook confirmation,
7. ledger allocation,
8. receipt generated in the payer's language,
9. payer notified.

Rules:

- Step 5 is not optional. Strong Customer Authentication is mandatory in several major markets, and a flow that assumes a single-step charge will fail there outright.
- Asynchronous and delayed-settlement methods — bank transfer, direct debit, cash voucher — can take days to confirm. The invoice must express "payment initiated" as a state distinct from "paid", and the payer must see it.
- A payment can be reversed weeks later on direct debit rails. Receipt issuance must not assume finality; reversal moves the invoice back to an unpaid state and is auditable.
- Payment method availability is resolved from country, never hard-coded into the UI.

---

### 9.5 Installment request

Parent can request.

Workflow:

```text
Requested
 -> Accounts review
 -> Approved / Rejected
 -> Schedule created
 -> Parent notified
```

---

### 9.6 Concession

Workflow can require approval.

Example:

```text
Accounts proposes concession
 -> Principal approves
 -> Student fee plan updated
 -> Future/open invoice recalculated according to policy
 -> Audit entry
```

---

### 9.7 Reminders and dunning

Segments:

- overdue
- due today
- due this week
- partial payment
- instalment due
- failed or reversed payment

Channels:

- in-app
- push
- email
- SMS/WhatsApp, where the channel is available and lawful in the recipient's country

Bulk campaigns require preview and audit.

Rules:

- Send time is evaluated in the recipient's timezone and respects local quiet hours. A tenant-timezone schedule will message international families overnight.
- Reminder content is rendered in the recipient's language, with amounts in the invoice currency and dates in the recipient's locale format.
- Fee reminders are transactional, but escalating collection messaging is regulated in some jurisdictions. Escalation policy is a per-jurisdiction setting.
- Late fees and interest are lawful in some markets and capped or prohibited in others. Late-fee rules belong to the tenant's jurisdiction profile, not to global defaults.
- Every recipient can be suppressed, and suppression is honoured across all channels immediately.

---

### 9.8 Reconciliation

Accounts view:

- gateway transactions
- bank settlement
- internal payment records
- unmatched transactions
- duplicates
- reversals
- failed webhooks

Reconciliation must handle a settlement currency that differs from the invoice currency, and record provider fees and any FX spread as their own entries rather than netting them against the invoice balance.

---

### 9.9 Credit notes, refunds and withdrawals

Corrections never edit an issued invoice.

```text
over-billed / error       -> credit note against the original invoice
learner withdraws         -> credit note for the unconsumed portion,
                             then refund of any surplus paid
duplicate payment         -> refund, no credit note (the invoice was correct)
concession applied late   -> credit note, then revised invoice if still payable
```

Refund workflow:

```text
Requested
 -> Eligibility check against the tenant's refund policy and jurisdiction
 -> Approval by an authorized role
 -> Refund issued to the original payment method where the rail allows
 -> Ledger updated, credit note linked
 -> Payer notified
```

Rules:

- Refund eligibility is a policy resolved from tenant jurisdiction and fee component, not a global rule. Statutory cooling-off and withdrawal rights apply in several markets, particularly to coaching and short courses sold to consumers.
- Refunds return to the original instrument wherever the rail supports it. Where it does not, the alternative payout path and its authorization are recorded.
- Partial refunds must specify which invoice lines they relate to, because tax treatment differs per line.
- Tax already reported to an authority is reversed through the credit note, and through the fiscal channel where the jurisdiction requires it.
- Every refund is audited with requester, approver, reason and amount.

### 9.10 Multi-currency and cross-border

- Each invoice is denominated in one currency, fixed at issue and never re-denominated.
- An institution may bill different learner populations in different currencies — for example local currency for domestic families and a second currency for international ones. Currency is therefore a property of the fee plan and the invoice, not of the tenant alone.
- Amounts are never displayed without a currency indicator.
- Consolidated multi-campus or group reporting across currencies must state the conversion rate and date used, and must never present a mixed-currency total as a single unlabelled figure.
- Where the payer is charged in a currency other than the invoice currency, the invoice currency remains authoritative for the balance. The charge currency, rate and any spread are recorded against the payment.

---

New message
Assignment published
Assignment due
Result published
Timetable changed
Substitution assigned
Admission stage changed
Offer expiring
```

Users configure preferences within school policy.

---

## 19. Restricted records and safeguarding

Some information must not be visible to every member of staff, and in several jurisdictions its handling carries statutory duties.

Restricted categories:

- safeguarding and child protection concerns,
- medical conditions, allergies, medication and care plans,
- special educational needs and disability assessments,
- counselling and wellbeing notes,
- behavioural and disciplinary records,
- legal orders affecting contact, custody or collection,
- financial hardship or free-meal eligibility.

Functionality:

- Each category is its own permission scope. Access to a learner record never implies access to a restricted category on it.
- Raising a concern is quick, private and always available to staff — a difficult reporting flow is a safeguarding failure in itself.
- A concern record has a designated lead, a status, a chronology and controlled sharing, with a full history that is never editable in place.
- Every access to a restricted record is logged with reason capture, and the institution's designated lead can review that log.
- Restricted records are excluded from search, exports, bulk reports, analytics and AI context unless the requester holds the specific scope.
- Contact and custody restrictions are expressed on the guardian link itself, so messaging, collection and visibility all honour them.
- Retention and transfer of these records follow the institution's statutory policy, separately from ordinary academic data.

The product records and evidences concerns. It does not assess or adjudicate them.

---

## 20. Consent and data rights

Institutions must be able to discharge their own legal obligations inside the product rather than by asking support.

Consent management:

- consent purposes are defined per tenant and per jurisdiction,
- capture, renewal, withdrawal and the source of each consent are recorded,
- withdrawal takes effect immediately across every channel and feature,
- where the learner is a minor, consent is held by the guardian; where the learner has reached the age of majority, it transfers to the learner, with notice to both.

Data subject requests:

```text
Received
 -> Identity verified
 -> Scope determined across modules
 -> Compiled / corrected / exported / deleted
 -> Reviewed and released
 -> Closed, with the whole chain audited
```

- Statutory response clocks are tracked and visible, because deadlines differ by jurisdiction.
- Deletion is per purpose. Academic records may be erasable while the invoices referencing them must be retained, and the workflow must express that outcome rather than failing.
- Export is available on demand and at contract termination, in a documented format.
- An institution can review its own access logs without contacting Eduvera.

---

## 21. Documents

## 37. Non-goals for the first release

Avoid trying to build everything schools might ever need.

Do not initially become:

- full accounting ERP,
- full video LMS,
- proctoring platform,
- school bus GPS hardware company,
- biometric hardware platform,
- generic social network.

Integrate or add later where strategically justified.

## 38. Product north star

A good EDUVERA session should let each person answer:

### Principal

“What needs attention?”

### Teacher

“What do I need to do for my classes today?”

### Accounts

“What money needs action?”

### Admissions

“Which family needs the next touch?”

### Parent

“What is happening with my child, and do I need to do anything?”

### Student

“What happens next, and what do I need to finish?”

### AI

“What can I safely answer or help accomplish using only what this person is allowed to access?”
